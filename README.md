### Common Issues

**Q: Processing takes too long**
A: Large documents (30MB+) may take 2-5 minutes. Our optimizations reduce this by 40-60% compared to standard processing.

**Q: API errors during processing**
A: Check your OpenAI API key and ensure you have sufficient credits. The system includes automatic retry logic for temporary failures.

**Q: Browser freezing on large files**
A: Our chunked processing prevents this, but very large files (50MB+) may still cause performance issues on lower-end devices.
